# Javascript-Number-Guesser
This is my first javascript project completed within my Code Academy career path course, I was tasked with integrating the javascript to make the game functional, and through this, I displayed my knowledge of javascript syntax, operators, functions, and more. Although this project is very simple, it is a crucial step in my journey with Javascript, and there will be many more to come.
